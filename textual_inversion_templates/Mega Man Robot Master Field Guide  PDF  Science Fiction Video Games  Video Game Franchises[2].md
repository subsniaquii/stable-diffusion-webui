It is a 2D action-platformer game that follows the adventures of Mega Man, a robot hero who fights against the evil Dr. Wily and his army of Robot Masters. Each Robot Master has a unique stage and a special weapon that Mega Man can acquire after defeating them.

The game also has four difficulty modes, ranging from Newcomer to Superhero, to suit different levels of skill and experience.
